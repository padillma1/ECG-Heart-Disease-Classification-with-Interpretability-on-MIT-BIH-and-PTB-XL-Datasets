# ECG-Heart-Disease-Classification-with-Interpretability-on-MIT-BIH-and-PTB-XL-Datasets
This work employs two models trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/#files-panel) and PTB-XL (https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/#files-panel) datasets to classify heart disease and provide interpretability results based on attention weights to determine the most significant segments in the ECG signals. The two models are a hierarchical attention network (HAN) (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf), originally created for text classification, and a Convolution-Attention-Transformer network, or CAT-Net (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809424002696#b40). The HAN consists of a convolutional layer, two LSTM + attention layers, and a fully-connected network, making it relatively compact. 

The code for the HAN and CAT-Net were run on Jupyter notebooks through Anaconda.
